        This platform provides three main microservices:
        1. Text Summarization - Uses advanced NLP to create concise summaries
        2. Q&A over Documents - Implements RAG for document question answering  
        3. Learning Path Suggestions - Generates personalized learning recommendations
        
        The system uses Flowise for AI orchestration and LangChain for LLM integration.
        All services are containerized and can be deployed using Docker.
